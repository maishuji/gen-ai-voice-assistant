# Building a Voice Assistant

## Objective of the project

### Learning objectives

- Explore chatbots and their applications
- Set up an environment using Python to build chatbots
- Acquire skills to integrate an LLM to infuse intelligence in a chatbot
- Implement speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities
- Create a functiong voice-enabled AI assitant

### Deliverables

A generative AI-Powered voice assistant in python, using OpenAI's GPT 3 and Watson IBM Embeddable AI.

- GPT-3 will enable the assistant to understand and respond to user input.
- The Watson Speech to Text (STT) empowers the assistant to hear and understand a user's response.
- Watson Text To Speech (TTS) enables the assistant to read the answers back to the user


## IBM Watson

It contains speech libraries for Embed
- Respond to human speech
- Process data and solve problems

## Steps

- Develop a production environment using Python
- Build chatbot using GPT-3
